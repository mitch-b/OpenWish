## Installation

### Docker Compose

Since OpenWish depends on an external datasource (PostgreSQL), if you don't already have a PostgreSQL instance to use, you can run an instance alongside the OpenWish application using Docker Compose:

```yaml
services:
  sql:
    image: postgres:17
    container_name: openwish-postgres
    environment:
      POSTGRES_USER: "openwish"
      POSTGRES_PASSWORD: "YourStrong!Passw0rd"
      POSTGRES_DB: "OpenWish"
    volumes:
      - openwish-data:/var/lib/postgresql@17/data
    ports:
      - 5432:5432

  web:
    image: ghcr.io/mitch-b/openwish-web:latest
    container_name: openwish-web
    environment:
      - ConnectionStrings__OpenWish=Server=sql;Port=5432;Database=OpenWish;User Id=openwish;Password=YourStrong!Passw0rd;
      - OpenWishSettings__OwnDatabaseUpgrades=true
    ports:
      - 5001:8080
    depends_on:
      - sql

volumes:
  openwish-data:
```
