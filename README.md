## Installation

### Docker Compose

Since OpenWish depends on an external datasource (SQL), if you don't already have a SQL instance to use, you can run a SQL instance alongside the OpenWish application using Docker Compose:

```yaml
services:
  sql:
    image: mcr.microsoft.com/mssql/server:2022-latest
    environment:
      SA_PASSWORD: "YourStrong!Passw0rd"
      ACCEPT_EULA: "Y"
    ports:
      - 1433:1433
    volumes:
      - openwish-data:/var/opt/mssql

  web:
    image: ghcr.io/mitch-b/openwish-web:latest
    environment:
      - ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT=Development
      - ConnectionStrings__OpenWish=Server=sql;Database=OpenWish;User Id=sa;Password=YourStrong!Passw0rd;Encrypt=optional;
      - OpenWish__OwnDatabaseUpgrades=true
    ports:
      - 5001:8080
    depends_on:
      - sql

volumes:
  openwish-data:
```

> Note: if you choose to bind volume mount the SQL data, see https://stackoverflow.com/a/77808783 to ensure your SQL directory has proper permissions applied.
